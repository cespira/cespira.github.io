description: "The Importance of Control Group"
---


Anyone that has contact with marketing execution or measurement, 
at some point in life, encountered a dilemma or a colleague that suggested:

- *"How about we run this one without the control group hum?"*

And here we are, discussing why this is, sometimes, a topic for arguing on marketing daily's and plannings.

I understand that having a holdout group can be challenging, sometimes even impossible
(I'll have a post on alternatives later),
but not having it is way more risky then one can imagine.

For the ones, that just like me, prefers the dumb down version of things,
Control group, or holdout, is basically prospects that are removed from
the original target list, creating a perfect comparison group for the actually
impacted prospects.

Problem is, to do that we need to REMOVE clients that could possibly convert at
the respective marketing piece, and sometimes that causes some bad reactions
from product teams, but let me try to explain why having a proper holdout is
essential to Marketing Analytics.

When we finish a campaign and finally analyze the results, we often use a Conversion Rate analysis,
basically number of conversions divided by total impacted clients. If we have a control, insights on results are easy,
we compare the conversion rates, identify its significance (a CHI Square is usually enough), and show the lift.
Abra, Kadabra, we have our results, properly compared and ready to be used as benchmark.

When there is NO control group though, its not that simple. Numbers are basically compared to nothing,
and even if you have another year's campaigns, similar pieces and arts, they won't tell a fair story. Seasonality,
economical situation, and god forbids, pandemics, can really skew the result when no proper comparison is made.
In the end all efforts will be in vain, since no actual conclusion or no data driven decision will be taken,
which usually leds to losses, or at leats less profit!

So, next time a colleague gently asks if he can ignore the holdout step, to keep 10 thousand prospects more,
kindly slap he in the face (I'M KIDDING, DON'T DO IT!),

You are welcome!
